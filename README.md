In our 2nd semester at Langara, we had to create an app and a website in 13 weeks. Wanderlust was our team's first project that was officially published. The app was to help users find unique events, activities, and travel spots according to their saved preferences. 

The journey to the finished product was not easy, but it was truly rewarding and satisfying to be able to see our project came to life. This definitely was a great learning experience.

You can take a look at our project with the link below and We hope you will like it. Thank you!
